An automatic pipeline targeting the prediction and visualisation of snacking behaviour to provoke profound reflection on the amount of snacks a person consumes on a daily basis. It consists of three core components:
- Snacked, an iOS mobile application for displaying snacking statistics.
- A machine learning model for identifying snacking activities based on accelerometer data.
- A Power Automate flow that enables automatic data transfer from a prediction script to Snacked.
